## FAQ

#### Why did you make this project?

I have always had a personal interest in finance and wanted to dabble in machine learning. I figured a project like this would help me develop a greater knowledge of things like backtesting while teaching me a bit of machine learning,

#### Does this mean you mastered Machine Learning?

Absolutely not. There is so much to learn about Machine Learning. This project *barely* scrapes the surface and only includes one implementation of ML, which was done with a library and not from scratch.

#### Can I use this to invest?

While the implementation *does* beat the market by about 3%, I would not recommend using this to invest. The goal of this algorithm is for educational use only. For an actual investment algorithm, I would suggest reading about the markets and creating your own (at your own risk). However, most people find that investing in index funds yields the best return on time invested.


## Roadmap

- Experiment with different step values.

- Test different forms of ML (like LSTM) and evaluate their success.
